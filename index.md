What's [the secret?](https://jeannkim.github.io/site/#the-secret)

## Things I find Interesting
### CS Education
In conjunction with being a tutor, I'm interested and involved in CS Education research. 

Here's one CS Ed paper I find interesting â€”
[Defensive Climate in the Computer Science Classroom](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/saf/dc/meetings/p43-barker.pdf). Some things this paper touches on, in the setting of a college CS course:

- Student posturing
    > "In many
cases, students ask questions that do not appear to be
seeking information, but to be displays of their own
knowledge. Students tend to use question forms such as,
"You can do __, right?" and "Isn't it true that __ "
"But doesn't it work [this way] in Java?" These are
intoned not as questions, but as statements."
- Equating experience to intelligence
    > "Since most people prefer not to be at the bottom and
since experience is equated to being smart, students often
engage in behaviors that demonstrate status and experience
or remain silent, avoiding notice by peers. These self representations reinforce hierarchy in the classroom."
- Calling things "easy"
    > "Prior to the deadline for the first
assignment for a junior-level course, one TA spent the
entire recitation session telling students how 'easy' the
assignment would be: "You won't have any problem with
[the assignment]. It will be simple. Only
26 out of more than 80 students received passing grades on
the assignment."

### Film and Media
I like making things. I made a short film this year as a part of **Triton Television**, a UCSD student filmmaking organization. 

[Here's a link](/media.md) to some media stuff I like.
